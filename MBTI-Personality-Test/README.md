MBTI Quick Personality Test

This project aims to simplify the 16-type MBTI personality test, enabling users to quickly and easily determine their MBTI personality type. By integrating advanced language models and streamlined interaction, users can answer a few key questions to discover their MBTI type without the need for a lengthy questionnaire.

The project is designed to run in Google Colab using NVIDIA APIs, leveraging their powerful AI infrastructure to provide fast, accurate personality type assessments. It combines deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze user responses and assign an appropriate MBTI type.

Project Overview
The MBTI Quick Personality Test project:

Simplifies MBTI assessment: Reduces the traditional lengthy MBTI questionnaire to a few essential questions.
Fast and efficient: Provides users with their MBTI type within seconds of answering the questions.
Powered by NVIDIA AI: Utilizes NVIDIA APIs to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of personality assessments.
Colab-ready: Runs seamlessly in a Google Colab environment, making it accessible without any local setup.
Prerequisites
Google Colab account.
NVIDIA API Key: You can obtain an API key from NVIDIA API Catalog.
Python 3.8+: Colab already comes with the required Python environment.
Installation
Open the Colab Notebook:

You can access the notebook through the following link: Colab Notebook.
Set up the NVIDIA API key:

Get your NVIDIA API key from the NVIDIA API Catalog.

Run the Notebook:

Simply execute all the cells in the Colab notebook to initialize the personality test. The notebook will prompt you with a few MBTI-related questions and provide your MBTI type based on your responses.
Usage
Once the notebook is running, the system will ask you a few key questions designed to classify your personality type along four axes:

Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I)
Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N)
Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F)
Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P)
The model analyzes your responses and generates a four-letter MBTI code (e.g., ENFP, ISTJ) that represents your personality type. The result is displayed in real time, and additional insights are provided based on your type.
